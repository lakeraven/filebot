## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-13

### Added
- Initial release of FileBot Healthcare MUMPS Modernization Platform
- **Architectural Achievement**: All optimization features integrated as first-class citizens in Core class
- Pure Java Native API integration for direct MUMPS global access
- **Modern Ruby development experience** for healthcare MUMPS systems
- Healthcare-specific workflow optimizations:
  - Patient lookup and demographics retrieval
  - Patient search by name with pattern matching
  - Batch patient operations for high-volume processing
  - Patient creation with validation
  - Clinical summary generation
- **Intelligent Caching System** with healthcare-specific TTL:
  - Demographics: 1 hour cache
  - Clinical data: 15 minutes cache  
  - Lab results: 30 minutes cache
- **Connection Pooling** optimized for IRIS Community connection limits
- **Query Routing** with automatic SQL vs Native API selection
- **Performance Monitoring** with real-time metrics and recommendations
- **Batch Processing** for efficient bulk operations
- Multi-platform MUMPS database support (IRIS ready, YottaDB/GT.M planned)
- Environment variables integration for production security
- Healthcare facility configurations (small clinic, medium clinic, large hospital, development)

### Performance Analysis
Verified against live InterSystems IRIS Community (5 runs average):
- FileBot vs Direct IRIS Global Operations: 1.5x overhead (58.0ms vs 37.8ms)
- **Result: Minimal performance overhead for significant modernization benefits**
- Trade-off: Small performance cost for modern Ruby development experience, testing frameworks, CI/CD integration, and maintainable code

### Security
- Encrypted environment variables support
- Environment variable fallback configuration
- Healthcare audit logging capabilities
- HIPAA compliance considerations
- Secure connection handling for sensitive medical data

### Documentation
- Complete deployment guide with multiple platform examples
- Installation automation script
- Healthcare workflow documentation
- Performance benchmark results
- Architecture overview and design decisions
- Security best practices guide

## Platform Compatibility

### Supported
- **Ruby**: JRuby 9.4+ (requires Java 21+ for InterSystems IRIS integration)
- **Databases**: InterSystems IRIS Health Community/Commercial
- **Platforms**: Docker, Kubernetes, Heroku, AWS ECS, bare metal

### Planned
- **Databases**: YottaDB, GT.M support in future versions
- **Protocols**: Protocol Buffers for enhanced performance
- **Memory**: Memory-mapped implementations for GT.M/YottaDB

## Healthcare Integration

FileBot is specifically designed for healthcare organizations using:
- VistA/RPMS electronic health record systems
- InterSystems IRIS for Health deployments  
- Legacy FileMan database applications
- MUMPS-based clinical information systems

Perfect for gradual modernization of healthcare IT infrastructure without disrupting existing clinical workflows or losing 40+ years of validated healthcare business logic.
