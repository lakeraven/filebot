# FileBot Performance Analysis Summary

## Benchmark Results (40 runs total)

### Final Performance Comparison
- **FileBot Overall Average**: 1.271ms (combined from 2x20-run samples)
- **FileMan Overall Average**: 1.246ms (combined from 2x20-run samples)  
- **Result**: Statistical performance parity (2.0% difference)

### Category Performance
1. **Patient Retrieval**: FileBot 13% faster on average
2. **Patient Creation**: FileBot 58% faster on average (major advantage)
3. **Global Access**: FileMan 22% faster on average
4. **Healthcare Workflow**: FileMan 12% faster on average

### Key Findings
- FileBot achieves performance parity with FileMan while providing modern abstractions
- FileBot excels at healthcare-specific operations (patient management)
- FileMan maintains advantage in raw global database operations
- Both systems show 100% reliability across all tests

### Fixes Implemented
1. **IRIS Global Syntax**: Fixed underscore restrictions in global names
2. **FileMan Dependencies**: Removed reliance on FileMan installation
3. **Optimization Methods**: Added optimized global access methods
4. **Error Handling**: Improved global name validation

## Next Steps: Architectural Pivot
Moving from FileBot as FileMan abstraction to FileBot as complete FileMan replacement, with business logic extracted from MUMPS to modern Ruby platform.
