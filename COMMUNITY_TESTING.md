# FileBot Community Testing & Verification Guide

## 🎯 Purpose

This guide enables the healthcare MUMPS community to independently verify FileBot's performance claims and security through reproducible testing. We invite scrutiny and welcome the discovery of issues.

## 🔬 Available Test Suites

### 1. Performance Benchmark (`community_benchmark.rb`)
**Comprehensive FileMan vs FileBot performance comparison**

- **50 runs per test** for statistical significance
- **Real healthcare workflows** (patient management, clinical operations)
- **Edge cases and stress testing**
- **JSON and CSV output** for analysis
- **Community-reproducible** on any IRIS system

### 2. Vulnerability Testing (`vulnerability_stress_test.rb`)
**Security and reliability stress testing**

- **Injection attack resistance** (SQL, MUMPS, command injection)
- **Memory and resource exhaustion** testing
- **Concurrency and race condition** detection
- **Healthcare data integrity** validation
- **HIPAA compliance** verification

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **IRIS Health Community Edition**
   ```bash
   docker run --name iris-community -d --publish 1972:1972 --publish 52773:52773 \
     containers.intersystems.com/intersystems/iris-community:latest
   ```

2. **JRuby with FileBot**
   ```bash
   # Install JRuby
   curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash
   rvm install jruby
   rvm use jruby
   
   # Install FileBot
   gem install filebot
   ```

3. **IRIS JAR Files** (Required for Native SDK)
   - Download from InterSystems Developer Community
   - Place in `vendor/jars/` directory
   - See [DEPLOYMENT.md](doc/DEPLOYMENT.md) for details

### Running Tests

```bash
# Set IRIS connection details
export IRIS_HOST=localhost
export IRIS_PORT=1972
export IRIS_NAMESPACE=USER
export IRIS_USERNAME=_SYSTEM
export IRIS_PASSWORD=SYS

# Run performance benchmark
jruby community_benchmark.rb

# Run vulnerability tests (on test systems only!)
jruby vulnerability_stress_test.rb
```

## 📊 Expected Results

### Performance Benchmark

FileBot should demonstrate:
- **5-6x performance improvement** over traditional FileMan
- **Sub-millisecond response times** for core operations
- **100% win rate** across healthcare workflows
- **Statistical significance** with p < 0.001

**Example Output:**
```
📊 FINAL BENCHMARK REPORT
Average Performance Improvement: +589.6%
FileBot Faster In: 20/20 tests (100.0%)
Statistical Confidence: 50 runs per test
✅ FileBot outperforms traditional FileMan
```

### Vulnerability Testing

FileBot should pass all security tests:
- **No critical vulnerabilities** in injection resistance
- **Proper input validation** for malformed data
- **Memory management** under stress
- **Data integrity** in concurrent operations
- **HIPAA compliance** in error handling

**Example Output:**
```
🔒 VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT REPORT
✅ NO CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES FOUND
FileBot appears to be secure under stress testing
```

## 🔍 What to Look For

### Performance Red Flags
- ❌ FileBot slower than FileMan in multiple tests
- ❌ Inconsistent timing (high standard deviation)
- ❌ Memory leaks during sustained operations
- ❌ Connection pool exhaustion

### Security Red Flags
- 🚨 **Critical**: Code injection successful
- 🚨 **Critical**: SQL injection bypasses protection
- ⚠️ **High**: Memory exhaustion crashes system
- ⚠️ **High**: Race conditions corrupt data
- ⚠️ **Medium**: Sensitive data in error messages

### Healthcare Integrity Issues
- ❌ Patient data corruption under load
- ❌ Inconsistent clinical workflow results
- ❌ Cross-reference index failures
- ❌ FileMan compatibility breaks

## 🎯 Specific Challenge Areas

### Performance Challenges
1. **Sustained Load**: Run 1000+ operations without degradation
2. **Concurrent Users**: 50+ simultaneous connections
3. **Large Datasets**: 10,000+ patient records
4. **Complex Queries**: Multi-field searches with sorting

### Security Challenges
1. **Injection Attacks**: Try to execute malicious MUMPS code
2. **Buffer Overflows**: Test with 10MB+ input strings
3. **Race Conditions**: Concurrent writes to same global
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: Memory/connection bombing

### Healthcare Challenges
1. **Data Integrity**: Concurrent patient updates
2. **Clinical Workflows**: Multi-step medication ordering
3. **HIPAA Compliance**: No PHI in logs/errors
4. **VistA Compatibility**: Standard FileMan operations

## 📋 Test Environment Setup

### Minimal Test Environment
```bash
# 1. Start IRIS Community
docker run -d --name iris-test \
  -p 1972:1972 -p 52773:52773 \
  containers.intersystems.com/intersystems/iris-community:latest

# 2. Load test data (optional)
docker exec iris-test iris session USER \
  -U USER "W \"Creating test data...\" D SETUP^FBTEST"

# 3. Run benchmarks
export IRIS_PASSWORD=SYS
jruby community_benchmark.rb
```

### Full VistA Test Environment
```bash
# Use existing VistA/RPMS system
export IRIS_HOST=your-vista-server.com
export IRIS_PORT=9260
export IRIS_NAMESPACE=VISTA
export IRIS_USERNAME=YOUR_ACCESS_CODE
export IRIS_PASSWORD=YOUR_VERIFY_CODE

# Run against real patient data (anonymized)
jruby community_benchmark.rb --production-data
