puts "\nüí° RECOMMENDATIONS:"
puts "   ‚Ä¢ Add UPDATE/DELETE operations for complete CRUD testing"
puts "   ‚Ä¢ Test cross-reference management and rebuilding"
puts "   ‚Ä¢ Validate data integrity and field constraints"

puts "   ‚Ä¢ Add sub-file and relational operations"
puts "   ‚Ä¢ Include healthcare-specific workflow testing"

puts "   1. Create extended test suite with priority operations"
puts "   2. Implement FileBot equivalents for missing functionality"
puts "   3. Validate architectural completeness"
puts "   4. Ensure healthcare domain coverage"
